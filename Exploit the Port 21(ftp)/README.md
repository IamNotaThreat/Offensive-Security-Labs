# FTP & Web Application Security Assessment — Lab Exercise

### **Overview**
In this repository, I've documented a lab exercise where I assessed the security of an FTP service and a related web application. I performed this exercise in a controlled virtual lab to demonstrate a realistic attack chain. I have redacted all exploit payloads and sensitive commands to highlight the process of vulnerability identification, impact assessment, and defensive remediation.

### **Scope**
- **Environment**: I performed this test in a virtual lab (VirtualBox) using a Kali Linux attacker VM against an intentionally vulnerable Debian 10 target VM ("academy").
- **Target services**: My focus was on vsftpd 3.0.3 (port 21) and Apache2 (port 80).

### **Tools & Techniques I Used (High-Level)**
- **Nmap**: For service discovery and version identification.
- **DirBuster**: To perform web application directory brute-forcing.
- **HashCat**: For offline password hash cracking.
- **Anonymous FTP Login**: To enumerate publicly accessible files.
- **Unrestricted File Upload**: To exploit a web application vulnerability for remote access.

### **My Key Findings**
- **Anonymous FTP Enabled**: I discovered that the FTP server allowed anonymous login, which led me to a sensitive note containing user credentials and application details.
- **Weak Credentials**: I found a user password by cracking a weak MD5 hash that was in the disclosed note.
- **Unrestricted File Upload**: I found that the student portal web application lacked proper file validation, which allowed me to upload a malicious PHP reverse shell.
- **Outdated Service Version**: I noted the FTP server was running `vsftpd 3.0.3`, an outdated version with publicly known vulnerabilities.

### **Impact**
- In a production environment, these vulnerabilities could lead to sensitive data exposure, unauthorized access to the web application, and ultimately, remote code execution, giving an attacker a foothold on the server.

### **Remediation & Hardening (High-Level)**
- **Disable Anonymous Login**: Anonymous FTP access should be disabled on any production server.
- **Enforce Strong Password Policies**: Avoid weak, easily crackable passwords and do not store credentials or hashes in plaintext files.
- **Implement Secure File Uploads**: The web application should be updated to validate file types, extensions, and content, and to prevent executable files from being uploaded or run.
- **Patch Management**: Keep all services, including FTP servers, updated to the latest stable versions to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
- **Network Segmentation**: Restrict access to sensitive applications from the public internet.
