# FTP & Web Application Security Assessment — Lab Exercise

### **Overview**
This repository contains an educational lab report assessing the security of an FTP service and a related web application. The exercise was performed in a controlled virtual lab to demonstrate a realistic attack chain. All exploit payloads and sensitive commands have been redacted. The goal is to highlight vulnerability identification, impact assessment, and defensive remediation strategies.

### **Scope**
- **Environment**: Virtual lab (VirtualBox) — A Kali Linux attacker VM and an intentionally vulnerable Debian 10 target VM ("academy").
- **Target services**: vsftpd 3.0.3 (port 21) and Apache2 (port 80).

### **Tools & Techniques (High-Level)**
- **Nmap**: Service discovery and version identification.
- **DirBuster**: Web application directory brute-forcing.
- **HashCat**: Offline password hash cracking.
- **Anonymous FTP Login**: Enumeration of publicly accessible files.
- **Unrestricted File Upload**: Exploitation of a web application vulnerability for remote access.

### **Key Findings**
- **Anonymous FTP Enabled**: The FTP server allowed anonymous login, leading to the disclosure of a sensitive note containing user credentials and application details.
- **Weak Credentials**: A user password was discovered by cracking a weak MD5 hash found in the disclosed note.
- **Unrestricted File Upload**: The student portal web application lacked proper file validation, allowing for the upload of a malicious PHP reverse shell.
- **Outdated Service Version**: The FTP server was running `vsftpd 3.0.3`, an outdated version with publicly known vulnerabilities.

### **Impact**
- In a production environment, these vulnerabilities could lead to sensitive data exposure, unauthorized access to the web application, and ultimately, remote code execution, giving an attacker a foothold on the server.

### **Remediation & Hardening (High-Level)**
- **Disable Anonymous Login**: Anonymous FTP access should be disabled on any production server.
- **Enforce Strong Password Policies**: Avoid weak, easily crackable passwords and do not store credentials or hashes in plaintext files.
- **Implement Secure File Uploads**: The web application should be updated to validate file types, extensions, and content, and to prevent executable files from being uploaded or run.
- **Patch Management**: Keep all services, including FTP servers, updated to the latest stable versions to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
- **Network Segmentation**: Restrict access to sensitive applications from the public internet.
